_ RESTFul API for CRUD operations using MongoDB as Database with Mongoose as modeler for AlkemyAPI. 

## ¬ø What you can do with this examples ? 

_You will be able to test the differents endpoints that I wrote and make the classics request methods as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations._

## ¬ø What knowledge do you need to understand this examples ? üõ†Ô∏è

_You need to have basic knowledge of the technologies used in the creation. I use_ 

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/) - As main language
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/es/) - To have our server
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/es) - As database to store the data. 

_You can use the console to interact with the database or download [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass). A very useful graphic interface for MongoDB_

## Installation 

_Download the project and open it in your code editor. And put on the console_

```
npm install
```

_This command will install the necessary dependencies for the project._

_After that you need to create your **.env** file following the **.env.example** file that I left. You will need it for the connection to MySQL and then put in the console_

```
npm start
```

_If everything went well, you should see something like this on the console_

```
Server Running in Port xxxx
Database Connected
```

_In this point we are more than ready to use the API!!_
